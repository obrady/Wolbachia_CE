# Wolbachia_CE
Code for simulating release of Wolbachia mosquitoes in Indonesia and assessing their cost effectiveness in different places over time


Codebook:

"scale_up_functions.R" - contains all the core functions for implementing the programme simulaitons and summarising the results

"scale_up_imp.R" - implements functions from "scale_up_functions.R" for specific geographies of interest in the paper

"Figures_and_tables.R" - processes the results of "scale_up_imp.R" into figures and tables for the main manuscript

"Area_cost_inference.R" - fits a simple relationship between human population density in the area of release and overall cost per square km of the programme using data from previous releases
